    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>My name is David Kruse and I am 19 years old. I took an interest to coding when I was young. I had a friend who's sister coded pages on MySpace in HTML and CSS. I saw it as a way for someone to provide a service to those who do not know how to use the internet themselves. I moved to Arizona to take Galvanizes' eight week program to see if coding truly was for me and I loved every moment of it. I began working at my brothers startup and editing bootstrap templates and creating landing pages for his clients.</h4>

    <h2>This Website</h2>
    <h4>This website was coded in a little under two hours using nothing but SynthWave music on Spotify, pepperoni pizza Hot Pockets, and the pure rage of being up at one a.m. because my allergies are so bad I feel like my nose is attempting to flee my face to seek a better life on the other side of the United States.</h4>
